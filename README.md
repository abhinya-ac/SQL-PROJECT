# SQL-PROJECT
## Library Management system
The Library Management System is a web-based application developed to automate working of a library.It manages books, customers, employees, and different types of transactions such as book issue and return. This project involves developing a Library Management System for the better user experience of both librarians and patrons. The resources will also be systematically organized.
## Data Analysis and Reporting:
SQL queries for reporting on the availability of books, activity of customers, and performance of employees.
Generation of daily/weekly/monthly reports on several metrics for decision-making.
## Database Design
The following tables are used by the project:
Books: This table contains information regarding the books. This includes book title, author, ISBN, category, and hire price.
Customer: The details of the customers of the library are stored here with their registration details.
Employee: The employees' details including name, salary, position, and branch.
IssueStatus: Maintains the information pertaining to the issue of a book to customers, like customer, book name, and date of issue. This shall help in keeping track of which book are issued to whom.
ReturnStatus: Holds information about returning a book. In this way, the availability of a particular book will always be updated properly.
## SQL Implementation
This project consists of a set of SQL queries for retrieval, manipulation, and reporting. The queries deal with both administrative information, like employees' salaries and count of various categories of books, and the user-linked inquiries, such as listing the available books or the customers who have not issued a book.
The Library Management System is a very strong tool for librarians and all those involved with the library to conduct smooth operations of a library while increasing user engagement. Building in efficient data management and reporting features into its architecture, the LMS becomes a very critical tool for modern libraries looking to enhance operational capabilities in their quest to better serve patrons.
